# Concept Curve Embeddings Indexation

A novel approach to unlimited-context AI, using Smart-Functions and Concept Curve theory to parse and reason over internal documents **without RAG or embeddings retraining**.

---

##  What is this?

This project demonstrates a cutting-edge alternative to traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling AI to process internal documentation with:

-  Unlimited context memory
-  No fine-tuning or embeddings required
-  Concept Curve-based reasoning
-  Smart-Functions compatible with any LLM
