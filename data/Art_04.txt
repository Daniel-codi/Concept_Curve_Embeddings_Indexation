collections.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964.
440.4102 Conflict of laws; provisions applicable.
Sec. 4102. (1) To the extent that items within this article are also within articles 3 and 8, they are subject to
those articles. If there is conflict, this article governs article 3 but article 8 governs this article.
(2) The liability of a bank for action or non-action with respect to an item handled by it for purposes of
presentment, payment, or collection is governed by the law of the place where the bank is located. In the case
of action or non-action by or at a branch or separate office of a bank, its liability is governed by the law of the
place where the branch or separate office is located.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4103 Variation by agreement; measure of damages; action constituting ordinary care.
Sec. 4103. (1) The effect of the provisions of this article may be varied by agreement but the parties to the
agreement cannot disclaim a bank's responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care
or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the
standards by which the bank's responsibility is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly
unreasonable.
(2) Federal Reserve regulations and operating circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like have the effect of
agreements under subsection (1), whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items
handled.
(3) Action or non-action approved by this article or pursuant to Federal Reserve regulations or operating
circulars is the exercise of ordinary care and, in the absence of special instructions, action or non-action
consistent with clearing-house rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by this
article, is prima facie the exercise of ordinary care.
(4) The specification or approval of certain procedures by this article is not disapproval of other procedures
which may be reasonable under the circumstances.
(5) The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the
item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care. If there is also
bad faith, it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence.

PART 2

COLLECTION OF ITEMS: DEPOSITARY AND COLLECTING BANKS

440.4201 Agency status of banks; provisional status of credits; applicability of article;
endorsement with pay any bank.
Sec. 4201. (1) Unless a contrary intent clearly appears and before the time that a settlement given by a
collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to the item, is an agent or sub-agent of
the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional. This provision applies regardless of
the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to
immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its
owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as
those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of setoff. If an item is handled by banks for
purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this article apply even
though action of parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.
(2) After an item has been indorsed with the words “pay any bank” or the like, only a bank may acquire the
rights of a holder until the item has been either of the following:
(a) Returned to the customer initiating collection.
(b) Specially endorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.

History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.

Sec. 4202. (1) A collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in all of the following:
(a) Presenting an item or sending it for presentment.
(b) Sending notice of dishonor or nonpayment or returning an item other than a documentary draft to the
bank's transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be.
(c) Settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement.
(d) Notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.
(2) A collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection (1) by taking proper action before its
midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice, or settlement. Taking proper action within a
reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of
establishing timeliness.
(3) Subject to subsection (1)(a), a bank is not liable for the insolvency, neglect, misconduct, mistake, or
default of another bank or person or for loss or destruction of an item in the possession of others or in transit.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4203 Collecting bank; instructions from transferor.
Sec. 4203. Subject to article 3 concerning conversion of instruments (section 3420) and restrictive
endorsements (section 3206) only a collecting bank's transferor can give instructions that affect the bank or
constitute notice to it, and a collecting bank is not liable to prior parties for any action taken pursuant to the
instructions or in accordance with any agreement with its transferor.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4204 Collecting bank; methods of sending items; presentment.
Sec. 4204. (1) A collecting bank shall send items by a reasonably prompt method, taking into consideration
relevant instructions, the nature of the item, the number of those items on hand, the cost of collection
involved, and the method generally used by it or others to present those items.

(2) A collecting bank may send:
(a) An item directly to the payor bank.
(b) An item to a nonbank payor if authorized by its transferor.
(c) An item other than documentary drafts to a nonbank payor, if authorized by federal reserve regulation
or operating circular, clearing-house rule, or the like.
(3) Presentment may be made by a presenting bank at a place where the payor bank or other payor has
requested that presentment be made.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1964, Act 250, Eff. Aug. 28, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4205 Depositary bank; item delivered by customer for collection.
Sec. 4205. If a customer delivers an item to a depositary bank for collection, then both of the following

if the bank satisfies the other requirements of section 3302, it is a holder in due course.
(b) The depositary bank warrants to collecting banks, the payor bank or other payor, and the drawer that
the amount of the item was paid to the customer or deposited to the customer's account.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4206 Transfer between banks.
Sec. 4206. Any agreed method which identifies the transferor bank is sufficient for the item's further
transfer to another bank.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964.
440.4207 Warranties of customer and collecting bank on transfer of items; accrual of cause
of action.
Sec. 4207. (1) A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other
consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank all of the following:
(a) That the warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item.
(b) That all signatures on the item are authentic and authorized.
(c) That the item has not been altered.
(d) That the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment under section 3305(1) of any party that
can be asserted against the warrantor.
(e) That the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the
maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.
(f) With respect to any remotely created consumer item, that the person on whose account the item is
drawn authorized the issuance of the item in the amount for which the item is drawn.
(2) If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or
other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item (i) according to the terms of the item at the
time it was transferred, or (ii) if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed
as stated in sections 3115 and 3407. The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any
subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith. A transferor cannot disclaim its obligation under
this subsection by an endorsement stating that it is made "without recourse" or otherwise disclaiming liability.
(3) A person to whom the warranties under subsection (1) are made and who took the item in good faith
may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a
result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a
result of the breach.
(4) The warranties stated in subsection (1) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a
claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of
the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the
delay in giving notice of the claim.
(5) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to
know of the breach.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993;⎯Am. 2014, Act 103, Imd. Eff. Apr. 10, 2014.
440.4208 Presentment of unaccepted or dishonored draft; warranties of person obtaining
payment and prior transferor; discharge; accrual of cause of action.
Sec. 4208. (1) If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 87 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
pays or accepts the draft, (i) the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and (ii) a
previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in

draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the
draft.

amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer
because of the payment. In addition the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest
resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by
any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft (i)
breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor, and (ii) if the acceptor makes payment with
respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts
stated in this subsection.
(3) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (1) based on an unauthorized
endorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the
endorsement is effective under section 3404 or 3405 or the drawer is precluded under section 3406 or 4406
from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized endorsement or alteration.
(4) If (i) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an endorser or (ii) any other item is
presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the item, and the item is paid, the person obtaining payment
and a prior transferor of the item warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or
was, at the time the warrantor transferred the item, a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain
payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item. The person making payment may recover from any
warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest
resulting from the breach.
(5) The warranties stated in subsections (1) and (4) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless
notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason
to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss
caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
(6) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to
know of the breach.

(2) A person who undertakes to retain an item pursuant to an agreement for electronic presentment
warrants to any subsequent collecting bank and to the payor bank or other payor that retention and
presentment of the item comply with the agreement. If a customer of a depositary bank undertakes to retain an
item, that bank also makes this warranty.
(3) A person to whom warranties are made under this section and who took the item in good faith may
recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result

Sec. 4210. (1) A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the
proceeds of any of the following:

given whether or not the credit is drawn upon and whether or not there is a right of charge-back.

(2) If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or
applied in part the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds
of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn.

the item, accompanying documents and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the
item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes
other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to article 9 except for the
following:

acceptance or payment. The notice must be sent in time to be received on or before the day when presentment

dollar amount of any charge-back or refund shall be calculated on the basis of the bank-offered spot rate for

will not receive payment in ordinary course.

final if the finality occurs automatically upon the lapse of certain time or the happening of certain events.

PART 4

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAYOR BANK AND ITS CUSTOMER

440.4401 Payor bank; charge against customer's account.
Sec. 4401. (1) A bank may charge against the account of a customer an item that is properly payable from
that account even though the charge creates an overdraft. An item is properly payable if it is authorized by the
customer and is in accordance with any agreement between the customer and bank.
(2) A customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor
benefited from the proceeds of the item.
(3) A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from
the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given
notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty. The notice is effective for
the period stated in section 4403(2) for stop-payment orders, and must be received at such time and in such
manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with
respect to the check described in section 4303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check
before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its
act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 4402.
(4) A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer
according to either of the following:
(a) The original terms of the altered item.
(b) The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the
bank has notice that the completion was improper.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4402 Payor bank; wrongful dishonor; liability to customer; determination of account
balance.
Sec. 4402. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this article, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it
dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft
unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft.
(2) A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an
item. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of
the customer or other consequential damages. Whether any consequential damages are proximately caused by
the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case.
(3) A payor bank's determination of the customer's account balance on which a decision to dishonor for
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 92 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by
the payor bank and the time that the payor bank returns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more
than 1 determination need be made. If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination
is made for the purpose of reevaluating the bank's decision to dishonor the item, the account balance at that
time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4403 Customer's right to stop payment; lapse and renewal; burden of proof of loss.
Sec. 4403. (1) A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than 1 person
may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer's account or close the account by an order to the bank
describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the
bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in
section 4303. If the signature of more than 1 person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons
may stop payment or close the account.
(2) A stop-payment order is effective for 6 months, but it lapses after 14 calendar days if the original order
was oral and was not confirmed in a record within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for
additional 6-month periods by a record given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order
is effective.
(3) The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary
to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item
contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 4402.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993;⎯Am. 2014, Act 103, Imd. Eff. Apr. 10, 2014.
440.4404 Payment of checks more than 6 months old.
Sec. 4404. A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other
than a certified check, which is presented more than 6 months after its date, but it may charge its customer's
account for a payment made thereafter in good faith.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964.
440.4405 Death or incompetence of customer.
Sec. 4405. (1) A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay or collect an item or to account for
proceeds of its collection if otherwise effective is not rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of
either bank existing at the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if the bank does not know of
an adjudication of incompetence. Neither death nor incompetence of a customer revokes such authority to
accept, pay, collect or account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incompetence
and has reasonable opportunity to act on it.
(2) Even with knowledge a bank may for 10 days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or
prior to that date unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964.
440.4406 Statement of account; identification of items paid; retention of items or copies;
customer's duty to discover and report unauthorized signature or alteration; failure to
comply with subsection (3); failure of bank to exercise ordinary care in paying item; time
limitation.
Sec. 4406. (1) A bank that sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment
of items for the account shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide
information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid.
The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount, and
date of payment.
(2) If the items are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items
or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration
of 7 years after receipt of the items. A customer may request an item from the bank that paid the item, and
that bank must provide in a reasonable time either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not
otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item.
(3) If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection (1), the
customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether
any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on
behalf of the customer was not authorized. If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 93 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the bank of the
relevant facts.
(4) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties imposed
on the customer by subsection (3), the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank the following:
(a) The customer's unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it
suffered a loss by reason of the failure.
(b) The customer's unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in
good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the
unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not
exceeding 30 days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.
(5) If subsection (4) applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in
paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the
customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the
customer to comply with subsection (3) and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the
loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection
(4) does not apply.
(6) Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not
within 1 year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection (1)) discover and
report his or her unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against
the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank
may not recover for breach of warranty under section 4208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or
alteration to which the preclusion applies.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.4407 Improper payment; subrogation of payor bank.
Sec. 4407. If a payor bank has paid an item over the order of the drawer or maker to stop payment, or after
an account has been closed, or otherwise under circumstances giving a basis for objection by the drawer or
maker, to prevent unjust enrichment and only to the extent necessary to prevent loss to the bank by reason of
its payment of the item, the payor bank is subrogated to the rights of the following:
(a) Of any holder in due course on the item against the drawer or maker.
(b) Of the payee or any other holder of the item against the drawer or maker either on the item or under the
transaction out of which the item arose.
(c) Of the drawer or maker against the payee or any other holder of the item with respect to the transaction
out of which the item arose.

Sec. 4501. A bank which takes a documentary draft for collection must present or send the draft and

440.4502 Documentary draft; presentment on arrival of goods, refusal for non-arrival; notice
to transferor.
Sec. 4502. When a draft or the relevant instructions require presentment “on arrival”, “when goods arrive”
or the like, the collecting bank need not present until in its judgment a reasonable time for arrival of the goods
has expired. Refusal to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank must notify
its transferor of such refusal but need not present the draft again until it is instructed to do so or learns of the
arrival of the goods.

after presentment; otherwise, only on payment; and
(b) upon dishonor, either in the case of presentment for acceptance or presentment for payment, may seek
and follow instructions from any referee in case of need designated in the draft or if the presenting bank does
not choose to utilize his services it must use diligence and good faith to ascertain the reason for dishonor,
must notify its transferor of the dishonor and of the results of its effort to ascertain the reasons therefor and
must request instructions.
But the presenting bank is under no obligation with respect to goods represented by the documents except
to follow any reasonable instructions seasonably received; it has a right to reimbursement for any expense
incurred in following instructions and to prepayment of or indemnity for such expenses.
