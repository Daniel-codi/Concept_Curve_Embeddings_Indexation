financial asset in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the
representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.

registered owner in the case of subsection (3)(b) or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection (4)(b)
retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate
instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the
uncertificated security or security entitlement.
(7) An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in

PART 2

ISSUE—ISSUER

440.8201 “Issuer” defined.
Sec. 8201. (1) With respect to an obligation on or a defense to a security, an “issuer” includes a person that
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 135 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
does 1 or more of the following:
(a) Places or authorizes the placing of its name on a security certificate, other than as authenticating
trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or similar person, to evidence a share, participation, or other interest in its
property or in an enterprise, or to evidence its duty to perform an obligation represented by the certificate.
(b) Creates a share, participation, or other interest in its property or in an enterprise, or undertakes an
obligation, that is an uncertificated security.
(c) Directly or indirectly creates a fractional interest in its rights or property, if the fractional interest is
represented by a security certificate.
(d) Becomes responsible for, or in place of, another person described as an issuer in this section.
(2) With respect to an obligation on or defense to a security, a guarantor is an issuer to the extent of its
guaranty, whether or not its obligation is noted on a security certificate.
(3) With respect to a registration of a transfer, issuer means a person on whose behalf transfer books are
maintained.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1987, Act 16, Imd. Eff. Apr. 24, 1987;⎯Am. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27,
1998.
440.8202 Terms of security; effect of defect going to validity of security; rules; defenses;
right of party to cancel contract.
Sec. 8202. (1) Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certified security
include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to
another instrument, indenture, or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, or order,
to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this
subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the
security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an
uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture, or document or in a constitution,
statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.
(2) The following rules apply if an issuer asserts that a security is not valid:
(a) A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for
value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional
provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the
defect, other than one who takes by original issue.
(b) Subdivision (a) applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issuer
or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and
a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in section 8205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a
complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.
(4) All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a
certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security
without notice of the particular defense.
(5) This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security “when, as and if
issued” or “when distributed” in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the
subject to the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or
distributed.
(6) If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security
entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if
the entitlement holder held the security directly.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1987, Act 16, Imd. Eff. Apr. 24, 1987;⎯Am. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27,
1998.
440.8203 Conditions to charging purchaser with notice of defect.
Sec. 8203. After an act or event, other than a call that has been revoked, creating a right to immediate
performance of the principal obligation represented by a certificated security or setting a date on or after
which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange, a purchaser is charged with
notice of any defect in its issue or defense of the issuer, if the act or event:
(a) Requires the payment of money, the delivery of a certificated security, the registration of transfer of an
uncertificated security, or any of them on presentation or surrender of the security certificate, the money or
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 136 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017

security is available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than 1
year after that date.
(b) Is not covered by subdivision (a) and the purchaser takes the security more than 2 years after the date
set for surrender or presentation or the date on which performance became due.

1998.
440.8204 Restriction on transfer of security.
Sec. 8204. A restriction on transfer of a security imposed by the issuer, even though otherwise lawful, is
ineffective against a person without knowledge of the restriction unless:
(a) The security is certificated and the restriction is noted conspicuously on the certificate.
(b) The security is uncertificated and the registered owner has been notified of the restriction.

1998.
440.8205 Unauthorized signature.
Sec. 8205. An unauthorized signature placed on a security certificate before or in the course of issue is
ineffective, but the signature is effective in favor of a purchaser for value of the certificated security if the
purchaser is without notice of the lack of authority and the signing has been done by:
(a) An authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or other person entrusted by the issuer with the
signing of the security certificate, or of similar security certificates, or the immediate preparation for signing
of any of them.
(b) An employee of the issuer, or of any of the persons listed in subdivision (a) entrusted with responsible
handling of the security certificate.

1998.
440.8206 Completion or alteration of security certificate.
Sec. 8206. (1) If a security certificate contains the signatures necessary to its issue or transfer but is
incomplete in any other respect, it may be completed as follows:
(a) Any person may complete it by filling in the blanks as authorized.
(b) Even though the blanks are incorrectly filled in, the security as completed is enforceable by a purchaser
who took it for value and without notice of the incorrectness.
(2) A complete security certificate that has been improperly altered, even if fraudulently, remains
enforceable, but only according to its original terms.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1987, Act 16, Imd. Eff. Apr. 24, 1987;⎯Am. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27,
1998.
440.8207 Rights of issuer or indenture trustee with respect to registered owner.
Sec. 8207. (1) Before due presentment for registration of transfer of a certificated security in registered
form, or of an instruction requesting registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, the issuer or
indenture trustee may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to vote, receive
notifications, and otherwise exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.
(2) This article does not affect the liability of the registered owner of a security for a call, assessment, or
the like.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1987, Act 16, Imd. Eff. Apr. 24, 1987;⎯Am. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27,
1998.
440.8208 Warranty of person signing security certificate.
Sec. 8208. (1) A person signing a security certificate as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or
the like, warrants to a purchaser for value of the certificated security, if the purchaser is without notice of the
particular defect, that:
(a) The certificate is genuine.
(b) The person's own participation in the issue of the security is within the person's capacity and within the
scope of the authority received by the person from the issuer.
(c) The person has reasonable grounds to believe that the certificated security is in the form and within the
amount the issuer is authorized to issue.

Sec. 8210. (1) In this section, “overissue” means the issue of securities in excess of the amount the issuer
has corporate power to issue, but an overissue does not occur if appropriate action has cured the overissue.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (3) and (4), the provisions of this article which validate a
security or compel its issue or reissue do not apply to the extent that validation, issue, or reissue would result
in overissue.
(3) If an identical security not constituting an overissue is reasonably available for purchase, a person
entitled to issue or validation may compel the issuer to purchase the security and deliver it if certificated or
register its transfer if uncertificated, against surrender of any security certificate the person holds.
(4) If a security is not reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may
recover from the issuer the price the person or the last purchaser for value paid for it with interest from the
date of the person's demand.

document and the certificate.
(4) If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary
indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied.
However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically

make a warranty.
(c) The signer had legal capacity to sign.
(3) A person who specially guarantees the signature of an originator of an instruction makes the warranties
of a signature guarantor under subsection (2) and also warrants that at the time the instruction is presented to

Sec. 8403. (1) A person who is an appropriate person to make an indorsement or originate an instruction
may demand that the issuer not register transfer of a security by communicating to the issuer a notification
that identifies the registered owner and the issue of which the security is a part and provides an address for
communications directed to the person making the demand. The demand is effective only if it is received by
the issuer at a time and in a manner affording the issuer reasonable opportunity to act on it.
(2) If a certificated security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer or
an instruction is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security after a
demand that the issuer not register transfer has become effective, the issuer shall promptly communicate to
the person who initiated the demand at the address provided in the demand and the person who presented the
security for registration of transfer or initiated the instruction requesting registration of transfer a notification
stating all of the following:
(a) The certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer or instruction for registration of
transfer of uncertificated security has been received.
(b) A demand that the issuer not register transfer had previously been received.

the notification. A shorter period may be specified by the issuer if it is not manifestly unreasonable.

(a) Obtain an appropriate restraining order, injunction, or other process from a court of competent
jurisdiction enjoining the issuer from registering the transfer.

Sec. 8501. (1) “Securities account” means an account to which a financial asset is or may be credited in
accordance with an agreement under which the person maintaining the account undertakes to treat the person
for whom the account is maintained as entitled to exercise the rights that comprise the financial asset.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (4) and (5), a person acquires a security entitlement if a
securities intermediary does 1 or more of the following:
(a) Indicates by book entry that a financial asset has been credited to the person's securities account.

securities account.
(3) If 1 or more conditions described in subsection (2)(a), (b), or (c) have been met, a person has a security

registered in the name of, payable to the order of, or specially indorsed to the other person, and has not been
indorsed to the securities intermediary or in blank, the other person is treated as holding the financial asset

History: Add. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27, 1998.

440.8502 Action based on adverse claim.
Sec. 8502. An action based on an adverse claim to a financial asset, whether framed in conversion,
replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against a person who acquires
a security entitlement under section 8501 for value and without notice of the adverse claim.
History: Add. 1998, Act 278, Imd. Eff. July 27, 1998.
440.8503 Entitlement holder property interest.
Sec. 8503. (1) To the extent necessary for a securities intermediary to satisfy all security entitlements with
respect to a particular financial asset, all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary are
held by the securities intermediary for the entitlement holders, are not property of the securities intermediary,
and are not subject to claims of creditors of the securities intermediary, except as otherwise provided in
section 8511.
(2) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (1)
is a pro rata property interest in all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary, without
regard to the time the entitlement holder acquired the security entitlement or the time the securities
intermediary acquired the interest in that financial asset.
(3) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection (1)
may be enforced against the securities intermediary only by exercise of the entitlement holder's rights under
sections 8505 through 8508.

entitlements of all of its entitlement holders to that financial asset.

all entitlement holders having security entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, may recover
the financial asset, or interest in a financial asset, from the purchaser. If the trustee or other liquidator elects
not to pursue that right, an entitlement holder whose security entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to
recover its interest in the financial asset from the purchaser.
(5) An action based on the entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset
under subsection (1), whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other
theory, may not be asserted against any purchaser of a financial asset or interest therein who gives value,
obtains control, and does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in violating the securities
intermediary's obligations under section 8504.
