of title.

terms the goods are to be delivered to bearer or to the order of a named person.
(2) A document of title other than one described in subsection (1) is nonnegotiable. A bill of lading that
states that the goods are consigned to a named person is not made negotiable by a provision that the goods are

however expressed, that it is nonnegotiable.

(2) If distilled spirits, agricultural commodities, or any other goods are stored under a statute requiring a
bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts in the nature of warehouse receipts, a receipt
issued for the goods is considered to be a warehouse receipt even if issued by a person that is the owner of the
goods and is not a warehouse.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7202 Terms of receipt; form; contrary provisions.
Sec. 7202. (1) A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.

caused to a person injured by its omission:
(a) A statement of the location of the warehouse where the goods are stored.
(b) The date of issue of the receipt.
(c) The unique identification code of the receipt.
(d) A statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a named person, or to a
named person or its order.
(e) The rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a field warehousing
arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on a nonnegotiable receipt.
(f) A description of the goods or the packages containing them.
(g) The signature of the warehouse or its agent.
(h) If the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owners, either solely, jointly, or in common with
others, a statement of the fact of that ownership.
(i) A statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for which the warehouse claims
a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances made or liabilities incurred, at the time of the
issue of the receipt, is unknown to the warehouse or to its agent that issued the receipt, in which case a
statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or
liabilities is sufficient.
(3) A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to the provisions of this act and do
not impair its obligation of delivery under section 7403 or its duty of care under section 7204. Any contrary
provisions are ineffective.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7203 Liability for nonreceipt or misdescription.
Sec. 7203. A party to or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title, other than a bill of lading,
that relies upon the description of the goods in the document may recover from the issuer damages caused by
the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that any of the following apply:
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 118 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
(a) The document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all or any part of the
goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in which the description is in terms
of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition, or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents,
condition, and quality unknown", "said to contain", or words of similar import, if the indication is true.
(b) The party or purchaser has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.

History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

440.7204 Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehouse liability; provisions as to time and
manner of presenting claims and commencing actions.
Sec. 7204. (1) A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its failure to
exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar
circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been
avoided by the exercise of that care.
(2) Damages may be limited by a term in a warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of
liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable. Such a limitation is not effective
with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion to its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at
the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt,
the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the
warehouse receipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.
(3) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based
on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7205 Fungible goods; buyer's title.
Sec. 7205. A buyer in the ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a warehouse
that is also in the business of buying and selling those goods takes the goods free of any claim under a
warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been duly negotiated.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7206 Termination of storage at warehouse's option; removal or sale; notice; delivery;
satisfaction of lien.
Sec. 7206. (1) A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held and any
other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any charges and removal of the
goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document of title or, if a
period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than 30 days after the warehouse gives notice. If the goods
are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to section 7210.
(2) If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than
the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (1) and section 7210, the warehouse may specify
in the notice given under subsection (1) any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods
are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than 1 week after a single advertisement or
posting.
(3) If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the
time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities, or other persons, the
warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable
notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort,
is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason
of that disposition.
(4) A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this article upon due demand
made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.
(5) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but
shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the warehouse would have been
bound to deliver the goods.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7207 Separation of goods; commingling of fungible goods; overissued receipts.
Sec. 7207. (1) Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separate the goods
covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of those goods. However,
different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 119 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
(2) If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common by the persons
entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share. If, because of
overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the receipts the warehouse has issued against it,
the persons entitled include all holders to which overissued receipts have been duly negotiated.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7208 Alteration of warehouse receipts.
Sec. 7208. If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority, a good
faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treat the insertion as authorized. Any
other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic warehouse receipt enforceable against the
issuer according to its original tenor.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7209 Warehouse's lien; security interest; "household goods" defined; loss of lien.
Sec. 7209. (1) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or
storage agreement or on the proceeds of those goods in its possession for charges for storage or transportation,
including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges, present or future, in relation to
the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale
pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in
relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that
a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the
goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds of those goods in its
possession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the
warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a
warehouse's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no
charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt
subsequent to the date of the receipt.
(2) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified
on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1), such as for money advanced and
interest. The security interest is governed by article 9.
(3) A warehouse's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) or a security interest under
subsection (2) is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods
that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid. However, the
lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal
interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not do any of the following:
(a) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's
nominee with any of the following:
(i) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell.
(ii) Power to obtain delivery under section 7403.
(iii) Power of disposition under section 2403, 2A304(2), 2A305(2), 9320, or 9321 or other statute or rule of
law.
(b) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.
(4) A warehouse's lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under
subsection (1) is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the
time of deposit. As used in this subsection, "household goods" means furniture, furnishings, or personal
effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.
(5) A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7210 Warehouse's lien; enforcement procedure; liability for noncompliance.
Sec. 7210. (1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), a warehouse's lien may be enforced by
public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are
commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification
must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any
public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method
different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made
in a commercially reasonable manner. A warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the
warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market for the goods, sells at the price
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 120 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
current in that market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable
practices among dealers in the type of goods sold. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be
offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the
preceding sentence.
(2) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its
business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:
(a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.
(b) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to
the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than 10 days after receipt of the notification,
and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale
and sold by auction at a specified time and place.
(c) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification.
(d) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored.
(e) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published
once a week for 2 weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The
advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are
being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first
publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement
must be posted at least 10 days before the sale in not fewer than 6 conspicuous places in the neighborhood of
the proposed sale.
(3) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount
necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that
event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and
this article.
(4) A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.
(5) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights
of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.
(6) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold
the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to
deliver the goods.
(7) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against
a debtor.
(8) If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in
accordance with subsection (1) or (2).
(9) A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this
section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1964, Act 250, Eff. Aug. 28, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
PART 3

BILLS OF LADING: SPECIAL PROVISIONS

440.7301 Negotiable bill of lading; issuer's liability for misdating, nonreceipt, or
misdescription; goods loaded by issuer of bill of lading; bulk; statement of shipper's
weight, load, and count; guarantee; liability.
Sec. 7301. (1) A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading which has given value in good faith, or a
holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying upon the description of the goods in the bill
or upon the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or
the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does
not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a
case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or
description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown", "said to contain",
"shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import, if that indication is true.
(2) All of the following apply if goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:
(a) The issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity
if shipped in bulk.
(b) Words such as "shipper's weight, load, and count", or words of similar import indicating that the
description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed in packages.
(3) If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 121 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time
after receiving the shipper's request in a record to do so. In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar
import are ineffective.
(4) The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load, and count", or
words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true,
the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, omission of those words does
not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.
(5) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels,
number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the
issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the
issuer's responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7302 Through bill of lading or other document of title; variance as to overseas
undertaking; obligations of persons other than issuer; obligations of persons to issuer.
Sec. 7302. (1) The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking
to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is liable to any person
entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other person or the performing carrier
of its obligation under the bill or other document. However, to the extent that the bill or other document
covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States
or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or
the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.
(2) If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be
performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person, the person is subject, with
respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer. The
person's obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other
document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.
(3) The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection (1) is entitled to
recover all of the following from the performing carrier, or other person in possession of the goods when the
breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:
(a) The amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for
the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript of judgment.
(b) The amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any action commenced by
any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach.

(b) The consignor on a nonnegotiable bill, even if the consignee has given contrary instructions.
(c) The consignee on a nonnegotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions from the consignor, if the
goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is in possession of the tangible bill or in control
of the electronic bill.
(d) The consignee on a nonnegotiable bill, if the consignee is entitled as against the consignor to dispose of
the goods.
(2) Unless instructions described in subsection (1) are included in a negotiable bill of lading, a person to
which the bill is duly negotiated may hold the bailee according to the original terms.

440.7304 Bills of lading in set of parts.
Sec. 7304. (1) Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading may not be
issued in a set of parts. The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this subsection.

negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiation is made prevails as to
both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder may have received the goods from the carrier
in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation by surrendering its part.
(4) A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issued in a set is liable to
holders of that part as if it were the whole set.
(5) The bailee shall deliver in accordance with part 4 against the first presented part of a tangible bill of
lading lawfully issued in a set. Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee's obligation on the whole bill.

440.7305 Destination and substitute bills.
Sec. 7305. (1) Instead of issuing a bill of lading to the consignor at the place of shipment, a carrier, at the
request of the consignor, may procure the bill to be issued at destination or at any other place designated in
the request.
(2) Upon request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods while in transit and on
surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or other receipt covering the goods, the
issuer, subject to section 7105, may procure a substitute bill to be issued at any place designated in the
request.

440.7306 Altered bills of lading.
Sec. 7306. An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the bill enforceable
according to its original tenor.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964.
440.7307 Carrier's lien.
Sec. 7307. (1) A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds of those
goods in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier's receipt of the goods for storage or
transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the
goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. However, against a
purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the
applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.
(2) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) on goods that the carrier was required by law to
receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the
carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to those charges and expenses. Any
other lien under subsection (1) is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to
have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.
(3) A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.

History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

440.7308 Carrier's lien; enforcement; procedure; liability for noncompliance.
Sec. 7308. (1) A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or
in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all
persons known to claim an interest in the goods. The notification must include a statement of the amount due,
the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could
have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not
of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. The carrier
sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any
recognized market for that type of goods, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale, or
otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.
A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not
commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
(2) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount
necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that
event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the carrier subject to the terms of the bill of lading
and this article.
(3) A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.
(4) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of
persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier's noncompliance with this section.
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 123 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
(5) A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the
balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver
the goods.
(6) The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against
a debtor.
(7) A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either subsection (1) or the procedure set forth in section
7210(2).
(8) A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this
section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7309 Carrier's duty of care; contractual provisions as to liability.
Sec. 7309. (1) A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the
degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar
circumstances. This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability
upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.
(2) Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the
carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are
dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the
consignor is advised of the opportunity. However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the
carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.
(3) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based
on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation agreement.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

PART 5

WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS AND BILLS OF LADING: NEGOTIATION AND TRANSFER

440.7501 Negotiable document of title; indorsement; notice of arrival.
Sec. 7501. (1) All of the following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:
(a) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the
named person's indorsement and delivery. After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any
person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.
(b) If the document's original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.
(c) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named
person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.
(d) Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the
named person and delivery.
(e) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that
purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and
for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or
involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
(2) All of the following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:
(a) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is
negotiated by delivery of the document to another person. Indorsement by the named person is not required to
negotiate the document.
(b) If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of
the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.
(c) A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that
purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person, and
for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or
involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.
(3) Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's
rights.
(4) The naming in a negotiable bill of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the
negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the
goods.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.
440.7502 Negotiation; rights acquired.
Sec. 7502. (1) Subject to sections 7205 and 7503, a holder to which a negotiable document of title is duly
negotiated acquires all of the following:
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 125 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
(a) Title to the document.
(b) Title to the goods.
(c) All rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee
after the document was issued.
(d) The direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document
free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this
article. However, in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee's
acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser
will procure the acceptance of the bailee.
(2) Subject to section 7503, title and rights acquired by due negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of
the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not impaired
even if any of the following occur:
(a) The due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty.
(b) Any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a
negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft, or
conversion.
(c) A previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.

History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

440.7503 Documents of title to goods; defeat in certain cases.
Sec. 7503. (1) A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuance of the
document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not do any of the
following:
(a) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or his or her
nominee with any of the following:
(i) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell.
(ii) Power to obtain delivery under section 7403.

rule of law.
(b) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.
(2) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a
negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. Such a title may
be defeated under section 7504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.
(3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any
person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated. However, delivery by the carrier in
accordance with part 4 of this article pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to
deliver.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2000, Act 348, Eff. July 1, 2001;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

defeat of transfer rights; diversion or change of shipping instructions; stoppage of
delivery.
Sec. 7504. (1) A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to which the
document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that its transferor had or had
actual authority to convey.
(2) In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives
notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated by any of the following:
(a) By those creditors of the transferor which could treat the transfer as void under section 2402 or 2A308.
(b) By a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the
buyer or received notification of the buyer's rights.
(c) By a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to
the lessee or received notification of the lessee's rights.
(d) As against the bailee, by good-faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.
(3) A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading
which causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if
the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business or a leasee in ordinary course of
business and, in any event, defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.
(4) Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stopped by a seller under
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 126 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov

supplied.

have its transferor supply any necessary indorsement, but the transfer becomes a negotiation only as of the
time the indorsement is supplied.

Sec. 7507. If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise than as a mere

selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only the following:

PART 6

WAREHOUSE RECEIPTS AND BILLS OF LADING: MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

440.7601 Lost, stolen, or destroyed documents of title; delivery of goods or issuance of
substitute document; indemnity.
Sec. 7601. (1) If a document of title is lost, stolen, or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or
issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order. If
the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute
document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result
of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss. If the
document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security. The court may also order payment of the bailee's
reasonable costs and attorney fees in any action under this subsection.
(2) A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable
document of title is liable to any person injured by that delivery. If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee
is liable for conversion. Delivery in good faith is not conversion if the claimant posts security with the bailee
in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by
the delivery which files a notice of claim within 1 year after the delivery.

440.7602 Judicial process; surrender of document of title; purchaser for value.
Sec. 7602. Unless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person that did
not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the
possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is outstanding unless possession or control of
the document is first surrendered to the bailee or the document's negotiation is enjoined. The bailee may not
be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is
surrendered to the bailee or to the court. A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process
or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2012, Act 87, Eff. July 1, 2013.

Sec. 7603. If more than 1 person claims title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused from

nondelivery of the goods or by original action.
