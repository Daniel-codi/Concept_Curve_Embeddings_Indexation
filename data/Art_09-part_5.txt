owner of the real property in each of the following circumstances:
(a) If the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property, and the
security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record
and has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner.
(b) If before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this
article and the fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is
not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property, or readily removable replacements of

to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction
mortgage.
(9) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of
an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest or record in or is in possession of
the real property.

reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other
than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party
need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by
the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement
may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the
obligation to reimburse.

attachments. If the debtor requests additional copies or searches, the fees provided in section 9525 apply to
that request.
(6) A person shall not knowingly or intentionally file a false or fraudulent financing statement with the

institution" defined.
Sec. 9501a. (1) A person identified as a debtor in a financing statement filed with the secretary of state
may file an affidavit with the secretary of state in the form prescribed under subsection (2) stating that the
financing statement is fraudulent. A person shall not file an affidavit under this subsection with respect to a

institution.
(2) The secretary of state shall adopt and make available a form affidavit to be used to give notice of a
fraudulent financing statement under subsection (1).

after the record reinstating the financing statement is filed. The continuation statement is effective as a filed
record from the date the financing statement would have lapsed. However, a financing or continuation
statement is not retroactive as provided in this subsection as against a purchaser of the collateral that gives
value in reasonable reliance on the absence of the record from the files.
(8) If the court in an action under this section determines that the financing statement is fraudulent, the filer
of the financing statement shall pay the costs and expenses incurred by the person identified as a debtor in the
financing statement in the action.

rendered ineffective by the absence of 1 or more of the following:
(a) A trade name or other name of the debtor.
(b) Unless required under subsection (1)(f)(ii), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons

(b) An indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property.

History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1978, Act 369, Eff. Jan. 1, 1979;⎯Am. 2000, Act 348, Eff. July 1, 2001.

(2) This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (1) and, as appropriate, to
compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 9311(2), but the filing or
compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is
determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the
consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or
compliance.

440.9506 Effect of errors or omissions.
Sec. 9506. (1) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even
if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously
misleading.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide
the name of the debtor in accordance with section 9503(1) is seriously misleading.
(3) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's
standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name
of the debtor in accordance with section 9503(1), the name provided does not make the financing statement
seriously misleading.
(4) For purposes of section 9508(2), the “debtor's correct name” in subsection (3) means the correct name
of the new debtor.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 2000, Act 348, Eff. July 1, 2001.
440.9507 Effect of certain events on effectiveness of financing statement.
Sec. 9507. (1) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold,
exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien
continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) and section 9508, a financing statement is not rendered
ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement
becomes seriously misleading under section 9506.
(3) If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of
the debtor under section 9503(1) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section
9506, both of the following apply:
(a) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor
before, or within 4 months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading.
(b) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor
more than 4 months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to
the financing statement that renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within 4 months
after the financing statement became seriously misleading.

440.9508 Effectiveness of financing statement if new debtor becomes bound by security
agreement.
Sec. 9508. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original
debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the
extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the
collateral.
(2) If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed
financing statement that is effective under subsection (1) to be seriously misleading under section 9506, both
of the following apply:
(a) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new
debtor before, and within 4 months after, the new debtor becomes bound under section 9203(4).
(b) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new
debtor more than 4 months after the new debtor becomes bound under section 9203(4) unless an initial
financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time.
(3) This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective
against the new debtor under section 9507(1).

(3) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its
effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4). Upon lapse, a
financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by

specified in subsection (1) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (2), whichever is applicable.

effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of 5 years commencing on the day on
which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration
of the 5-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (3), unless,
before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (4). Succeeding continuation
statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.
(6) If a debtor is an organization identified as a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so
indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. A financing statement that
is filed before March 29, 2009 is effective for a period of 5 years after the date of filing and shall not be
continued under this section if the financing statement indicates either of the following:
(a) That the debtor is an individual purporting to be a transmitting utility.
(b) That the debtor is an individual showing his or her name as an organization and purporting to be a
transmitting utility.
(7) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under section
9502(3) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or
satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property.
