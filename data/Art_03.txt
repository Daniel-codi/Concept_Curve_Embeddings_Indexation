persons jointly or in the alterative but not in succession. An authorization to pay is not an order unless the
person authorized to pay is also instructed to pay.
(h) "Ordinary care" in the case of a person engaged in business means observance of reasonable
commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which the person is located, with respect to the business in

1201(2)(h).
(m) "Remitter" means a person who purchases an instrument from its issuer if the instrument is payable to

Compiler's note: In subsection (1)(g), “alterative” evidently should read “alternative.”
440.3104 Additional definitions.
Sec. 3104. (1) Except as provided in subsections (3) and (4), “negotiable instrument” means an
unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges
described in the promise or order, if all of the following apply:
(a) It is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder.
(b) It is payable on demand or at a definite time.
(c) It does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do
any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain an undertaking or power to
give, maintain, or protect collateral to secure payment, an authorization or power to the holder to confess
judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral, or a waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the
advantage or protection of an obligor.
(2) “Instrument” means a negotiable instrument.
(3) An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection (1), except subdivision (a), and otherwise falls
within the definition of “check” in subsection (6) is a negotiable instrument and a check.
(4) A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into
possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise
or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this article.
(5) An instrument is a “note” if it is a promise and is a “draft” if it is an order. If an instrument falls within
the definition of both “note” and “draft”, a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.
(6) “Check” means a draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank or a
cashier's check or teller's check. An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by
another term, such as “money order”.
(7) “Cashier's check” means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or
branches of the same bank.
(8) “Teller's check” means a draft drawn by a bank on another bank, or payable at or through a bank.
(9) “Traveler's check” means an instrument that is payable on demand, is drawn on or payable at or
through a bank, is designated by the term “traveler's check” or by a substantially similar term, and requires, as
a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.
(10) “Certificate of deposit” means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of
money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of
deposit is a note of the bank.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3105 “Issue” and “issuer” defined; effect of unissued or conditionally issued instrument.
Sec. 3105. (1) “Issue” means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a
holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.
(2) An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the
maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a
special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be
fulfilled is a defense.
(3) “Issuer” applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1964, Act 250, Eff. Aug. 28, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3106 Unconditional status of promise or order.
Sec. 3106. (1) Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of section 3104(1), a promise or order is
unconditional unless it states 1 of the following:
(a) An express condition to payment.
(b) That the promise or order is subject to or governed by another record.
(c) That rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another record. A reference
to another record does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.
(2) A promise or order is not made conditional by or because of either of the following:
(a) By a reference to another record for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment, or
acceleration.
(b) Because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.
(3) If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose
specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 60 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
conditional for the purposes of section 3104(1). If the person whose specimen signature appears on an
instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the
issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the
instrument.
(4) If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a
statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or
transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise
or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 3104(1); but if the promise or order is an
instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993;⎯Am. 2014, Act 101, Imd. Eff. Apr. 10, 2014.

instrument is paid.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3108 Instrument payable on demand, at definite time, or at fixed date.
Sec. 3108. (1) A promise or order is “payable on demand” if it:
(a) States that it is payable on demand or at sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the
holder.
(b) Does not state any time of payment.
(2) A promise or order is “payable at a definite time” if it is payable on elapse of a definite period of time
after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the
promise or order is issued, subject to rights of:
(a) Prepayment.
(b) Acceleration.
(c) Extension at the option of the holder.
(d) Extension to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or automatically upon or after
a specified act or event.

instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for payment is not made before that date,
becomes payable at a definite time on the fixed date.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.

at fixed date.

identified person.
(2) A promise or order that is not payable to bearer is payable to order if it is payable:

(b) To an identified person or order. A promise or order that is payable to order is payable to the identified
person.
(3) An instrument payable to bearer may become payable to an identified person if it is specially endorsed
pursuant to section 3205(1). An instrument payable to an identified person may become payable to bearer if it
is endorsed in blank pursuant to section 3205(2).
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3110 Determination of person payable; intent; signature by automated means;
determining holder; instrument payable to 2 or more persons.
Sec. 3110. (1) The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the
person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The
instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 61 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than 1 person signs in the name
or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the
instrument is payable to any person intended by 1 or more of the signers.
(2) If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing
machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or
identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.
(3) A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name,
identifying number, office, or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument,
the following rules apply:
(a) If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is
payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument is payable to an account identified by
number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that
person is the owner of the account identified by number.
(b) If an instrument is payable to any of the following:
(i) A trust, an estate, or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is
payable to the trustee, the representative, or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is
also named.
(ii) A person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is
payable to the represented person, the representative, or a successor of the representative.
(iii) A fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the
members of the fund or organization.
(iv) An office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person,
the incumbent of the office, or a successor to the incumbent.
(4) If an instrument is payable to 2 or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be
negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is
payable to 2 or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged,
or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to 2 or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is
payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3111 Place of payment.
Sec. 3111. Except as otherwise provided for items in article 4, an instrument is payable at the place of
payment stated in the instrument. If no place of payment is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of
the drawee or maker stated in the instrument. If no address is stated, the place of payment is the place of
business of the drawee or maker. If a drawee or maker has more than 1 place of business, the place of
payment is any place of business of the drawee or maker chosen by the person entitled to enforce the
instrument. If the drawee or maker has no place of business, the place of payment is the residence of the
drawee or maker.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.

Sec. 3112. (1) Unless otherwise provided in the instrument:
(a) An instrument is not payable with interest.
(b) Interest on an interest-bearing instrument is payable from the date of the instrument.
(2) Interest may be stated in an instrument as a fixed or variable amount of money or it may be expressed
as a fixed or variable rate or rates. The amount or rate of interest may be stated or described in the instrument
in any manner and may require reference to information not contained in the instrument. If an instrument
provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot be ascertained from the description, interest is
payable at the judgment rate in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first
accrues.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1964, Act 250, Eff. Aug. 28, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3113 Instrument antedated, postdated, or undated.
Sec. 3113. (1) An instrument may be antedated or postdated. The date stated determines the time of
payment if the instrument is payable at a fixed period after date. Except as provided in section 4401(3), an
instrument payable on demand is not payable before the date of the instrument.
(2) If an instrument is undated, its date is the date of its issue or, in the case of an unissued instrument, the
date it first comes into possession of a holder.

440.3115 Incomplete instrument; definition; enforcement; alteration; burden.
Sec. 3115. (1) “Incomplete instrument” means a signed writing, whether or not issued by the signer, the
contents of which show at the time of signing that it is incomplete but that the signer intended it to be
completed by the addition of words or numbers.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), if an incomplete instrument is an instrument under section 3104, it may be
enforced according to its terms if it is not completed, or according to its terms as augmented by completion. If
an incomplete instrument is not an instrument under section 3104, but, after completion, the requirements of
section 3104 are met, the instrument may be enforced according to its terms as augmented by completion.
(3) If words or numbers are added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer, there is an
alteration of the incomplete instrument under section 3407.
(4) The burden of establishing that words or numbers were added to an incomplete instrument without

endorsers are jointly and severally liable in the capacity in which they sign.

Compiler's note: In subsection (2), “pay” evidently should read “pays.”
440.3117 Obligation modified, supplemented, or nullified by separate agreement.
Sec. 3117. Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or previous
agreements, the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified, supplemented,
or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the
instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same
transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented, or nullified by
an agreement under this section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.

requires transfer of possession of the instrument and its endorsement by the holder. If an instrument is payable
to bearer, it may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone.

Sec. 3202. (1) Negotiation is effective even if obtained (i) from an infant, a corporation exceeding its
powers, or a person without capacity, (ii) by fraud, duress, or mistake, or (iii) in breach of duty or as part of an
illegal transaction.
(2) To the extent permitted by other law, negotiation may be rescinded or may be subject to other
remedies, but those remedies may not be asserted against a subsequent holder in due course or a person
paying the instrument in good faith and without knowledge of facts that are a basis for rescission or other
remedy.

440.3203 Transfer of instrument; delivery; rights of transferee; effect of transfer of less than
entire instrument.
Sec. 3203. (1) An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the
purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.
(2) Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right
of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee
cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course
if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a
holder because of lack of endorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to
the unqualified endorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the
endorsement is made.
(4) If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not
occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this article and has only the rights of a partial assignee.

440.3204 “Endorsement” and “endorser” defined; transfer of security interest effective as
unqualified endorsement; instrument payable to name other than holder.
Sec. 3204. (1) “Endorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor,
that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the
instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring endorser's liability on the instrument,
but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an endorsement unless the
accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other circumstances unambiguously
indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than endorsement. For the purpose of determining
whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.
(2) “Endorser” means a person who makes an endorsement.
(3) For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an endorsement that
transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified endorsement of the instrument.
(4) If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, endorsement
may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name or both, but signature
in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3205 Special endorsement; blank endorsement; conversion; “anomalous endorsement”
defined.
Sec. 3205. (1) If an endorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified
person or payable to bearer, and the endorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument
payable, it is a “special endorsement”. When specially endorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the
identified person and may be negotiated only by the endorsement of that person. The principles stated in
section 3110 apply to special endorsements.
(2) If an endorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special endorsement, it is a
“blank endorsement”. When endorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be
negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially endorsed.
(3) The holder may convert a blank endorsement that consists only of a signature into a special
endorsement by writing, above the signature of the endorser, words identifying the person to whom the
instrument is made payable.
(4) “Anomalous endorsement” means an endorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the
instrument. An anomalous endorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be
negotiated.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3206 Endorsement; limitation; condition; words indicating collection by bank; endorsee
as agent, trustee, or other fiduciary; purchaser as holder in due course; exception;
defense.
Sec. 3206. (1) An endorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further
transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the
instrument.
(2) An endorsement stating a condition to the right of the endorsee to receive payment does not affect the
right of the endorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or
collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether
the condition has been fulfilled.
(3) If an instrument bears an endorsement (i) described in section 4201(2), or (ii) in blank or to a particular
bank using the words “for deposit”, “for collection”, or other words indicating a purpose of having the
instrument collected by a bank for the endorser or for a particular account, the following rules apply:
(a) A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so endorsed converts the instrument
unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the endorser or applied consistently with the
endorsement.
(b) A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so endorsed converts
the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the endorser
or applied consistently with the endorsement.
(c) A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over
the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 65 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
instrument are received by the endorser or applied consistently with the endorsement.
(d) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c), a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the
endorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the endorser or applied
consistently with the endorsement.
(4) Except for an endorsement covered by subsection (3), if an instrument bears an endorsement using
words to the effect that payment is to be made to the endorsee as agent, trustee, or other fiduciary for the
benefit of the endorser or another person, the following rules apply:
(a) Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in section 3307, a person who purchases
the instrument from the endorsee or takes the instrument from the endorsee for collection or payment may pay
the proceeds of the payment or the value given for the instrument to the endorsee without regard to whether
the endorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the endorser.
(b) A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor
otherwise affected by the restriction in the endorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the
fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.
(5) The presence on an instrument of an endorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a
purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a
converter under subsection (3) or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection
(4).
(6) In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if
payment would violate an endorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this
section.

440.3207 Instrument; reacquisition.
Sec. 3207. Reacquisition of an instrument occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or
otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel endorsements made after the reacquirer
first became a holder of the instrument. If the cancellation causes the instrument to be payable to the
reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer may negotiate the instrument. An endorser whose endorsement is
canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against any subsequent holder.

Compiler's note: The repealed section pertained to reacquisition of instruments.
PART 3

ENFORCEMENT OF INSTRUMENTS

440.3301 Instrument; person entitled to enforce.
Sec. 3301. “Person entitled to enforce” an instrument means (i) the holder of the instrument, (ii) a
nonholder in possession of the instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (iii) a person not in possession of
the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 3309 or 3418(4). A person may be
a person entitled to enforce the instrument even though the person is not the owner of the instrument or is in
wrongful possession of the instrument.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3302 Holder in due course; notice of discharge as effective against holder; rights of
holder; time and manner of notice; section subject to law limiting status.
Sec. 3302. (1) Subject to subsection (3) and section 3106(4), “holder in due course” means the holder of an
instrument if both of the following apply:
(a) The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery
or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.
(b) The holder took the instrument (i) for value, (ii) in good faith, (iii) without notice that the instrument is
overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an incurred default with respect to payment of another
instrument issued as part of the same series, (iv) without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized
signature or has been altered, (v) without notice of any claim to the instrument described in section 3306, and
(vi) without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in section 3305(1).
(2) Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a
defense under subsection (1), but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 66 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a
defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument.
(3) Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person
does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken (i) by legal process or by purchase in
an execution, bankruptcy, or creditor's sale or similar proceeding, (ii) by purchase as part of a bulk transaction
not in ordinary course of business of the transferor, or (iii) as the successor in interest to an estate or other
organization.
(4) If under section 3303(1)(a) the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has
been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the
fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by
the value of the promised performance.
(5) If (i) the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and (ii)
the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment, or claim to the instrument that
may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the
instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which,
at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.
(6) To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity
to act on it.
(7) This section is subject to any law limiting status as a holder in due course in particular classes of
transactions.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3303 Instrument issued or transferred for value; consideration.
Sec. 3303. (1) An instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply:
(a) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the promise has been
performed.
(b) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by
judicial proceeding.
(c) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against
any person, whether or not the claim is due.
(d) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument.
(e) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a
third party by the person taking the instrument.
(2) “Consideration” means any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. The drawer or maker
of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration. If an instrument is issued for
a promise of performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance of the promise is due and the
promise has not been performed. If an instrument is issued for value as stated in subsection (1), the instrument
is also issued for consideration.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3304 Instruments payable on demand or payable at definite time as overdue; conditions.
Sec. 3304. (1) An instrument payable on demand becomes overdue at the earliest of the following times:
(a) On the day after the day demand for payment is duly made.
(b) If the instrument is a check, 90 days after its date.
(c) If the instrument is not a check, when the instrument has been outstanding for a period of time after its
date which is unreasonably long under the circumstances of the particular case in light of the nature of the
instrument and usage of the trade.
(2) With respect to an instrument payable at a definite time, the following rules apply:
(a) If the principal is payable in installments and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument
becomes overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment, and the instrument
remains overdue until the default is cured.
(b) If the principal is not payable in installments and the due date has not been accelerated, the instrument
becomes overdue on the day after the due date.
(c) If a due date with respect to principal has been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day
after the accelerated due date.
(3) Unless the due date of principal has been accelerated, an instrument does not become overdue if there
is default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal.

440.3305 Right to enforce obligation; defenses or claims available; statement; section
subject to other law.
Sec. 3305. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the right to enforce the obligation of a party to
pay an instrument is subject to the following:
(a) A defense of the obligor based on (i) infancy of the obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple
contract, (ii) duress, lack of legal capacity, or illegality of the transaction which, under other law, nullifies the
obligation of the obligor, (iii) fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor
reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms, or (iv) discharge of the obligor in
insolvency proceedings.
(b) A defense of the obligor stated in another section of this article or a defense of the obligor that would
be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple
contract.
(c) A claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose
from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument, but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a
transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is
brought.
(2) The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject
to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection (1)(a), but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in
subsection (1)(b) or claims in recoupment stated in subsection (1)(c) against a person other than the holder.
(3) Except as stated in subsection (4), in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the
instrument, the obligor may not assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument a defense, claim in
recoupment, or claim to the instrument in section 3306 of another person, but the other person's claim to the
instrument may be asserted by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts the
claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if
the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the
obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.
(4) In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the
accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in
recoupment under subsection (1) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to
enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal
capacity.
(5) In a consumer transaction, if law other than this article requires that an instrument include a statement
to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to a claim or defense that the issuer could
assert against the original payee, and the instrument does not include such a statement, all of the following
apply:
(a) The instrument has the same effect as if the instrument included such a statement.
(b) The issuer may assert against the holder or transferee all claims and defenses that would have been
available if the instrument included such a statement.
(c) The extent to which claims may be asserted against the holder or transferee is determined as if the
instrument included such a statement.
(6) This section is subject to law other than this article that establishes a different rule for consumer
transactions.

440.3306 Instrument; person subject to claim of property or possessory right.
Sec. 3306. A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, is
subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to
rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder in due
course takes free of the claim to the instrument.

440.3307 Fiduciary duty; breach.
Sec. 3307. (1) As used in this section:

a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.
(b) “Represented person” means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation, or other person to
whom the duty stated in subdivision (a) is owned.

(2) If (i) an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, (ii) the taker has
knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary, and (iii) the represented person makes a claim to the
instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the
following rules apply:
(a) Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary is notice of the claim of the represented person.
(b) In the case of an instrument payable to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has
notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or as security for a debt
known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker to be
for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary,
as such, or an account of the represented person.
(c) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the
fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless the taker knows of
the breach of fiduciary duty.
(d) If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, to the taker as payee, the
taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is (i) taken in payment of or as security for a
debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary, (ii) taken in a transaction known by the taker
to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary, or (iii) deposited to an account other than an account of the
fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.

440.3308 Establishing validity of signature; burden; right to payment subject to defense or
claim in recoupment; holder in due course not subject to defense or claim.
Sec. 3308. (1) In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each
signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a
signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but
the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the
purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the
signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a
person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that
the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under section 3402(1).
(2) If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection (1), a
plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the
instrument under section 3301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or
claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except
to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to
the defense or claim.

440.3309 Enforcement of instrument in which loss of possession occurred.
Sec. 3309. (1) A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if all of the
following are met:
(a) The person meets either of the following:
(i) Was entitled to enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred.
(ii) Has directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person that was entitled to
enforce the instrument when loss of possession occurred.
(b) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure.
(c) The person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was
destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or
a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.
(2) A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection (1) must prove the terms of the
instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that proof is made, section 3308 applies to the
case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in
favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is
adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the
instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

check; suspension of obligation; other instruments.
Sec. 3310. (1) Unless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier's check, or teller's check is taken for an
obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal
to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not
affect any liability that the obligor may have as an endorser of the instrument.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection (1), if a note or an uncertified check is
taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if
an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:
(a) In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or
until it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results in discharge of the obligation to the
extent of the amount of the check.
(b) In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid.
Payment of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.
(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), if the check or note is dishonored and the obligee of the
obligation for which the instrument was taken is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligee may
enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In the case of an instrument of a third person which is
negotiated to the obligee by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the
obligation.
(d) If the person entitled to enforce the instrument taken for an obligation is a person other than the
obligee, the obligee may not enforce the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee is
the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession of it because it was lost, stolen, or
destroyed, the obligation may not be enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to
that extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement of the instrument.
(3) If an instrument other than one described in subsection (1) or (2) is taken for an obligation, the effect is
(i) that stated in subsection (1) if the instrument is one on which a bank is liable as maker or acceptor, or (ii)
that stated in subsection (2) in any other case.

440.3311 Discharge; tender as full satisfaction of claim.
Sec. 3311. (1) If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that (i) that person in good faith
tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, (ii) the amount of the claim was
unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute, and (iii) the claimant obtained payment of the instrument, the
following subsections apply.
(2) Unless subsection (3) applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted
proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to
the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), a claim is not discharged under subsection (2) if either of the following
applies:
(a) The claimant, if an organization, proves that (i) within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant
sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications
concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a
designated person, office, or place, and (ii) the instrument or accompanying communication was not received
by that designated person, office, or place.
(b) The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within 90 days after payment of the
instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the
claim is asserted. This subdivision does not apply if the claimant is an organization that sent a statement
complying with subdivision (a)(i).
(4) A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable
time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct
responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full
satisfaction of the claim.

(a) "Check" means a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check.
(b) "Claimant" means a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's check, teller's
check, or certified check that was lost, destroyed, or stolen.
(c) "Declaration of loss" means a statement, made in a record under penalty of perjury, to the effect that all
of the following apply:
(i) The declarer lost possession of a check.
(ii) The declarer is the drawer or payee of the check in the case of a certified check, or the remitter or
payee of the check in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check.
(iii) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure.
(iv) The declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check was destroyed, its
whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that
cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.
(d) "Obligated bank" means the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check or the acceptor of a certified
check.
(2) A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank
describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check if all of the
following apply:
(a) The claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or
teller's check.
(b) The communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to
the check.
(c) The communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on
it before the check is paid.
(d) The claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank.

(b) Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check
or, in the case of a teller's check, may permit the drawee to pay the check. Payment to a person entitled to
enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.
(c) If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not
obliged to pay the check.
(d) When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the

presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder in due course, the claimant is obliged to do both
of the following:
(a) Refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid.
(b) Pay the amount of the check to the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is

a cashier's check, teller's check, or certified check which is lost, destroyed, or stolen, the claimant may assert
rights with respect to the check either under this section or section 3309.

the represented person under section 3402.
(2) A signature may be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any

name, including a trade or assumed name, or by a word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person
with present intention to authenticate a writing.

440.3402 Liability of parties; signature by authorized representative.
Sec. 3402. (1) If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing
either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the
signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract.
If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the “authorized signature of the
represented person” and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the
instrument.
(2) If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an
authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:
(a) If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the
represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.
(b) Subject to subsection (3), if (i) the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the
signature is made in a representative capacity or (ii) the represented person is not identified in the instrument,
the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice
that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other person, the
representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not
intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.
(3) If a representative signs the name of the representative as drawer of a check without indication of the
representative status and the check is payable from an account of the represented person who is identified on
the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized signature of the represented
person.

440.3403 Unauthorized signature; effect.

organization, the signature of the organization is unauthorized if 1 of the required signatures is lacking.
(3) The civil or criminal liability of a person who makes an unauthorized signature is not affected by any
provision of this article which makes the unauthorized signature effective for the purposes of this article.

440.3404 Imposter; inducing issuance of instrument; endorsement in name of payee; failure
to exercise ordinary care.
Sec. 3404. (1) If an imposter, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue
the instrument to the imposter, or to a person acting in concert with the imposter, by impersonating the payee
of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an endorsement of the instrument by any person
in the name of the payee is effective as the endorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith,
pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.
(2) If (i) a person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable in section 3110(1) or (2) does
not intend the person identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument, or (ii) the person identified as
payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, the following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by
special endorsement:
(a) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder.
(b) An endorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as the
endorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or
for collection.
(3) Under subsection (1) or (2), an endorsement is made in the name of a payee if (i) it is made in a name
substantially similar to that of the payee or (ii) the instrument, whether or not endorsed, is deposited in a
depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.
(4) With respect to an instrument to which subsection (1) or (2) applies, if a person paying the instrument
or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and
that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the

loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary
care contributed to the loss.

440.3405 Definitions; fraudulent endorsement by employee or person acting in concert with
employee.
Sec. 3405. (1) As used in this section:
(a) “Employee” includes an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained by
the employer.
(b) “Fraudulent endorsement” means (i) in the case of an instrument payable to the employer, a forged
endorsement purporting to be that of the employer, or (ii) in the case of an instrument with respect to which
the employer is the issuer, a forged endorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.
(c) “Responsibility” with respect to instruments means authority (i) to sign or endorse instruments on
behalf of the employer, (ii) to process instruments received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for
deposit to an account, or for other disposition, (iii) to prepare or process instruments for issue in the name of
the employer, (iv) to supply information determining the names or addresses of payees of instruments to be
issued in the name of the employer, (v) to control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of
the employer, or (vi) to act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity. “Responsibility”
does not include authority that merely allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or
incomplete instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail, or
similar access.
(2) For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith, pays an
instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility
with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a
fraudulent endorsement of the instrument, the endorsement is effective as the endorsement of the person to
whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person. If the person paying the instrument or
taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that
failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from
the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the
loss.
(3) Under subsection (2), an endorsement is made in the name of the person to whom an instrument is
payable if (i) it is made in a name substantially similar to the name of that person or (ii) the instrument,
whether or not endorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to the
name of that person.

440.3406 Failure to exercise ordinary care contributing to alteration or forged instrument;
allocation of loss; burden of proof.
Sec. 3406. (1) A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of
an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the
alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for
collection.
(2) Under subsection (1), if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or
taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person
precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to
exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.
(3) Under subsection (1), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting
the preclusion. Under subsection (2), the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person
precluded.

Sec. 3407. (1) “Alteration” means (i) an unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in
any respect the obligation of a party, or (ii) an unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to
an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party.
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose
obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration.
No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.

faith and without notice of the alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument (i) according to its
original terms, or (ii) in the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according
to its terms as completed.

440.3408 Check or draft; operation as assignment.
Sec. 3408. A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the
drawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until the drawee accepts it.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3409 Acceptance of draft; definition; operation; “certified check” defined; refusal to
certify.
Sec. 3409. (1) “Acceptance” means the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as presented. It must be
written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and
becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the
purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.
(2) A draft may be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer, is otherwise incomplete, is
overdue, or has been dishonored.
(3) If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder
may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith.
(4) “Certified check” means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made
as stated in subsection (1) or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified. The drawee
of a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not dishonor of the check.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.
440.3410 Acceptance varying from terms of draft.
Sec. 3410. (1) If the terms of a drawee's acceptance vary from the terms of the draft as presented, the
holder may refuse the acceptance and treat the draft as dishonored. In that case, the drawee may cancel the
acceptance.
(2) The terms of a draft are not varied by an acceptance to pay at a particular bank or place in the United
States, unless the acceptance states that the draft is to be paid only at that bank or place.
(3) If the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of each drawer and
endorser that does not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged.
History: 1962, Act 174, Eff. Jan. 1, 1964;⎯Am. 1993, Act 130, Eff. Sept. 30, 1993.

recoverable.
Sec. 3411. (1) As used in this section, “obligated bank” means the acceptor of a certified check or the

(2) If the obligated bank wrongfully (i) refuses to pay a cashier's check or certified check, (ii) stops
payment of a teller's check, or (iii) refuses to pay a dishonored teller's check, the person asserting the right to
enforce the check is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the nonpayment
and may recover consequential damages if the obligated bank refuses to pay after receiving notice of
particular circumstances giving rise to the damages.
(3) Expenses or consequential damages under subsection (2) are not recoverable if the refusal of the
obligated bank to pay occurs because (i) the bank suspends payments, (ii) the obligated bank asserts a claim
or defense of the bank that it has reasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to
enforce the instrument, (iii) the obligated bank has a reasonable doubt whether the person demanding
payment is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, or (iv) payment is prohibited by law.

440.3412 Note, cashier's check, or other draft; obligation of issuer to pay according to terms.
Sec. 3412. The issuer of a note or cashier's check or other draft drawn on the drawer is obliged to pay the
instrument (i) according to its terms at the time it was issued or, if not issued, at the time it first came into
possession of a holder, or (ii) if the issuer signed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when
completed, to the extent stated in sections 3115 and 3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to
enforce the instrument or to an endorser who paid the instrument under section 3415.

440.3413 Draft; obligation to pay according to terms; amount.
Sec. 3413. (1) The acceptor of a draft is obliged to pay the draft (i) according to its terms at the time it was
accepted, even though the acceptance states that the draft is payable “as originally drawn” or equivalent

the acceptance is of a draft that is an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the
extent stated in sections 3115 and 3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the draft or to
the drawer or an endorser who paid the draft under section 3414 or 3415.
(2) If the certification of a check or other acceptance of a draft states the amount certified or accepted, the
obligation of the acceptor is that amount. If (i) the certification or acceptance does not state an amount, (ii) the
amount of the instrument is subsequently raised, and (iii) the instrument is then negotiated to a holder in due
course, the obligation of the acceptor is the amount of the instrument at the time it was taken by the holder in
due course.

period.
Sec. 3414. (1) This section does not apply to cashier's checks or other drafts drawn on the drawer.
(2) If an unaccepted draft is dishonored, the drawer is obliged to pay the draft (i) according to its terms at
the time it was issued or, if not issued, at the time it first came into possession of a holder, or (ii) if the drawer
signed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 3115
and 3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the draft or to an endorser who paid the draft
under section 3415.
(3) If a draft is accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged, regardless of when or by whom acceptance
was obtained.
(4) If a draft is accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation of the drawer to pay the draft if the
draft is dishonored by the acceptor is the same as the obligation of an endorser under section 3415(1) and (3).
(5) If a draft states that it is drawn “without recourse” or otherwise disclaims liability of the drawer to pay
the draft, the drawer is not liable under subsection (2) to pay the draft if the draft is not a check. A disclaimer
of the liability stated in subsection (2) is not effective if the draft is a check.
(6) If (i) a check is not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for collection within 30 days
after its date, (ii) the drawee suspends payments after expiration of the 30-day period without paying the
check, and (iii) because of the suspension of payments, the drawer is deprived of funds maintained with the
drawee to cover payment of the check, the drawer to the extent deprived of funds may discharge its obligation
to pay the check by assigning to the person entitled to enforce the check the rights of the drawer against the
drawee with respect to the funds.

instrument at the time it was endorsed, or (ii) if the endorser endorsed an incomplete instrument, according to
its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 3115 and 3407. The obligation of the endorser is
owed to a person entitled to enforce the instrument or to a subsequent endorser who paid the instrument under
this section.
(2) If an endorsement states that it is made “without recourse” or otherwise disclaims liability of the
endorser, the endorser is not liable under subsection (1) to pay the instrument.
(3) If notice of dishonor of an instrument is required by section 3503 and notice of dishonor complying
with that section is not given to an endorser, the liability of the endorser under subsection (1) is discharged.
(4) If a draft is accepted by a bank after an endorsement is made, the liability of the endorser under
subsection (1) is discharged.
(5) If an endorser of a check is liable under subsection (1) and the check is not presented for payment, or

440.3416 Transfer of instrument for consideration; endorsement; warranties.
Sec. 3416. (1) A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants to the transferee and, if the

(b) That all signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized.
(c) That the instrument has not been altered.
(d) That the instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be
asserted against the warrantor.
(e) That the warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the
maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.
(f) With respect to a remotely created consumer item, that the person on whose account the item is drawn
authorized the issuance of the item in the amount for which the item is drawn.
(2) A person to whom the warranties under subsection (1) are made and who took the instrument in good
faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered
as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the instrument plus expenses and loss of interest
incurred as a result of the breach.
(3) The warranties stated in subsection (1) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a
claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason to know of
the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (2) is discharged to
the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
(4) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to
know of the breach.

440.3417 Presentment of unaccepted or dishonored draft; rights of parties.
Sec. 3417. (1) If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee
pays or accepts the draft, (i) the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and (ii) a
previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee making payment or accepting the
draft in good faith all of the following:
(a) That the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce
the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce
the draft.
(b) That the draft has not been altered.
(c) That the warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the draft is unauthorized.
(d) With respect to any remotely created consumer item, that the person on whose account the item is

(2) A drawee making payment may recover from any warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to
the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer
because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest
resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by
any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft, breach
of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor. If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the
draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this
subsection.
(3) If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection (1) based on an unauthorized
endorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the
endorsement is effective under section 3404 or 3405 or the drawer is precluded under section 3406 or 4406
from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized endorsement or alteration.
(4) If (i) a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an endorser or (ii) any other
instrument is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the instrument, and (iii) payment is received, the
following rules apply:
(a) The person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the instrument warrant to the person making
payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the instrument, a
person entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to
enforce the instrument.
(b) The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal
to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.

(5) The warranties stated in subsections (1) and (4) cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless
notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within 30 days after the claimant has reason
to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection (2) or
(4) is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.
(6) A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to
know of the breach.

440.3418 Payment or acceptance by mistake.
Sec. 3418. (1) Except as provided in subsection (3), if the drawee of a draft pays or accepts the draft and
the drawee acted on the mistaken belief that (i) payment of the draft had not been stopped pursuant to section
4403 or (ii) the signature of the drawer of the draft was authorized, the drawee may recover the amount of the
draft from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or, in the case of acceptance, may
revoke the acceptance. Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to
exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.
(2) Except as provided in subsection (3), if an instrument has been paid or accepted by mistake and the
case is not covered by subsection (1), the person paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law
governing mistake and restitution, (i) recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose benefit
payment was made or (ii) in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.
(3) The remedies provided by subsection (1) or (2) may not be asserted against a person who took the
instrument in good faith and for value or who in good faith changed position in reliance on the payment or
acceptance. This subsection does not limit remedies provided by section 3417 or 4407.
(4) Notwithstanding section 4215, if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and the payor or acceptor
recovers payment or revokes acceptance under subsection (1) or (2), the instrument is deemed not to have
been paid or accepted and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is recovered has
rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored instrument.

440.3419 Accommodation parties.
Sec. 3419. (1) If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument
("accommodated party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation party") signs the instrument
for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given
for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for accommodation".
(2) An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or endorser and, subject
to subsection (4), is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs.
The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and
whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation.
(3) A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the
instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous endorsement or is accompanied by
words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party
to the instrument. Except as provided in section 3605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the
instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument
was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.
(4) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the
party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the
signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if
(i) execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied, (ii) the other party is insolvent
or in an insolvency proceeding, (iii) the other party cannot be served with process, or (iv) it is otherwise
apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.
(5) If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating that the party guarantees
payment or the signer signs the instrument as an accommodation party in some other manner that does not
unambiguously indicate an intention to guarantee collection rather than payment, the signer is obliged to pay
the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument in the same circumstances as
the accommodated party would be obliged, without prior resort to the accommodated party by the person
entitled to enforce the instrument.
(6) An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the
accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. In proper
circumstances, an accommodation party may obtain relief that requires the accommodated party to perform its
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 77 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
obligations on the instrument. An accommodated party that pays the instrument has no right of recourse
against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.

440.3420 Conversion.
Sec. 3420. (1) The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument
is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the
instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to
enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (
i) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or (ii) a payee or endorsee who did not receive delivery of the
instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.
(2) In an action under subsection (1), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the
instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.
(3) A representative, other than a depository bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its
proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion
to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.

or rule.
(4) The party to whom presentment is made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day

of dishonor or nonpayment under section 4301 or 4302, or becomes accountable for the amount of the check

(a) If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to
the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.
(b) If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made
to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever
is later.
(5) In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment
is excused under section 3504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or
paid.
(6) If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to
demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never
having been dishonored.

440.3503 Notice of dishonor; manner; sufficiency; time periods.
Sec. 3503. (1) The obligation of an endorser stated in section 3415(2) and the obligation of a drawer stated

(2) Notice of dishonor may be given by any person; may be given by any commercially reasonable means,
including an oral, written, or electronic communication; and is sufficient if it reasonably identifies the

an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice of dishonor.
(3) Subject to section 3504(3), with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank,
notice of dishonor must be given (i) by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the
banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument, or (ii) by any other person

instrument presentment is not necessary to enforce the obligation of endorsers or the drawer, (iv) the drawer

or right to require that the instrument be paid or accepted, or (v) the drawer instructed the drawee not to pay or
accept the draft or the drawee was not obligated to the drawer to pay the draft.

DISCHARGE AND PAYMENT

440.3601 Discharge; effect against holder in due course.
Sec. 3601. (1) The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is discharged as stated in this article or by an
act or agreement with the party which would discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract.
(2) Discharge of the obligation of a party is not effective against a person acquiring rights of a holder in
due course of the instrument without notice of the discharge.

(2) Subject to subsection (5), a note is paid to the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party
obliged to pay the note to a person that formerly was entitled to enforce the note only if at the time of the
payment the party obliged to pay has not received adequate notification that the note has been transferred and
that payment is to be made to the transferee. A notification is adequate only if it is signed by the transferor or
the transferee; reasonably identifies the transferred note; and provides an address at which payments
subsequently are to be made. Upon request, a transferee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the
note has been transferred. Unless the transferee complies with the request, a payment to the person that
formerly was entitled to enforce the note is effective for purposes of subsection (3) even if the party obliged to
pay the note has received a notification under this subsection.
(3) Subject to subsection (5), to the extent of a payment under subsections (1) and (2), the obligation of the
party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment is made with knowledge of a claim to
the instrument under section 3306 by another person.
(4) Subject to subsection (5), a transferee, or any party that has acquired rights in the instrument directly or
indirectly from a transferee, including any party that has acquired those rights and that has rights as a holder
in due course, is deemed to have notice of any payment that is made under subsection (2) after the date that
the note is transferred to the transferee but before the party obliged to pay the note receives adequate
notification of the transfer.
(5) The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is not discharged under subsections (1) to (4) if either of
the following applies:
(a) A claim to the instrument under section 3306 is enforceable against the party receiving payment and (i)
payment is made with knowledge by the payor that payment is prohibited by injunction or similar process of a
court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) in the case of an instrument other than a cashier's check, teller's check,
or certified check, the party making payment accepted, from the person having a claim to the instrument,
indemnity against loss resulting from refusal to pay the person entitled to enforce the instrument.

(2) If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the
instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the
obligation of an endorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to
which the tender relates.
(3) If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the
instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is
discharged. If presentment is required with respect to an instrument and the obligor is able and ready to pay
on the due date at every place of payment stated in the instrument, the obligor is deemed to have made tender
of payment on the due date to the person entitled to enforce the instrument.

instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation, or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out
of the party's signature, or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge, or (ii) by agreeing not
to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed record.

rights of a party derived from the endorsement.

440.3605 Secondary obligor; rights and duties; agreement to modification or to extend time
when payments are due; obligation secured by interest in collateral; discharge; impairing
value of interest in collateral; knowledge of accommodation; consent or waiver of
discharge; release or extension; burden of persuasion; presumption.
Sec. 3605.
(1) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument releases the obligation of a principal obligor in whole or in
part, and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to the obligation of that principal
obligor, the following rules apply:
(a) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary obligor with respect to any previous payment
by the secondary obligor are not affected. Unless the terms of the release preserve the secondary obligor's
recourse, the principal obligor is discharged, to the extent of the release, from any other duties to the
secondary obligor under this article.
(b) Unless the terms of the release provide that the person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the
right to enforce the instrument against the secondary obligor, the secondary obligor is discharged to the same
extent as the principal obligor from any unperformed portion of its obligation on the instrument. If the
instrument is a check and the obligation of the secondary obligor is based on an indorsement of the check, the
secondary obligor is discharged without regard to the language or circumstances of the discharge or other
release.
(c) If the secondary obligor is not discharged under subdivision (b), the secondary obligor is discharged to
the extent of the value of the consideration for the release, and to the extent that the release would otherwise
cause the secondary obligor a loss.
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 81 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
(2) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument grants a principal obligor an extension of the time at which
1 or more payments are due on the instrument and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with
respect to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following rules apply:
(a) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary obligor with respect to any previous payment
by the secondary obligor are not affected. Unless the terms of the extension preserve the secondary obligor's
recourse, the extension correspondingly extends the time for performance of any other duties owed to the
secondary obligor by the principal obligor under this article.
(b) The secondary obligor is discharged to the extent that the extension would otherwise cause the
secondary obligor a loss.
(c) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged under subdivision (b), the secondary obligor
may perform its obligations to a person entitled to enforce the instrument as if the time for payment had not
been extended or, unless the terms of the extension provide that the person entitled to enforce the instrument
retains the right to enforce the instrument against the secondary obligor as if the time for payment had not
been extended, treat the time for performance of its obligations as having been extended correspondingly.
(3) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a modification of
the obligation of a principal obligor other than a complete or partial release or an extension of the due date
and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to the obligation of that principal
obligor, the following rules apply:
(a) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary obligor with respect to any previous payment
by the secondary obligor are not affected. The modification correspondingly modifies any other duties owed
to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor under this article.
(b) The secondary obligor is discharged from any unperformed portion of its obligation to the extent that
the modification would otherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss.
(c) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged under subdivision (b), the secondary obligor
may satisfy its obligation on the instrument as if the modification had not occurred, or treat its obligation on
the instrument as having been modified correspondingly.
(4) If the obligation of a principal obligor is secured by an interest in collateral, another party to the
instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to that obligation, and a person entitled to enforce the
instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of the secondary obligor is discharged
to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent the value of the
interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the recourse of the secondary obligor, or the
reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the recourse
exceeds the value of the interest. For purposes of this subsection, impairing the value of an interest in
collateral includes failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral, release of
collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value or equivalent reduction of the underlying obligation,
failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under article 9 or other law, to a debtor or
other person secondarily liable, and failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of or otherwise
enforcing the interest in collateral.
(5) A secondary obligor is not discharged under subsection (1)(c), (2), (3), or (4) unless the person entitled
to enforce the instrument knows that the person is a secondary obligor or has notice under section 3419(3)
that the instrument was signed for accommodation.
(6) A secondary obligor is not discharged under this section if the secondary obligor consents to the event
or conduct that is the basis of the discharge, or the instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides
for waiver of discharge under this section specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive
defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise,
consent by the principal obligor to an act that would lead to a discharge under this section constitutes consent
to that act by the secondary obligor if the secondary obligor controls the principal obligor or deals with the
person entitled to enforce the instrument on behalf of the principal obligor.
(7) A release or extension preserves a secondary obligor's recourse if the terms of the release or extension
provide both of the following:
(a) That the person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the instrument against the
secondary obligor.
(b) That the recourse of the secondary obligor continues as if the release or extension had not been granted.
(8) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (9), a secondary obligor asserting discharge under this
section has the burden of persuasion both with respect to the occurrence of the acts alleged to harm the
secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by those acts.
(9) If the secondary obligor demonstrates prejudice caused by an impairment of its recourse, and the
circumstances of the case indicate that the amount of loss is not reasonably susceptible of calculation or
Rendered Wednesday, December 27, 2017 Page 82 Michigan Compiled Laws Complete Through PA 182 of 2017
© Legislative Council, State of Michigan Courtesy of www.legislature.mi.gov
requires proof of facts that are not ascertainable, it is presumed that the act impairing recourse caused a loss or
impairment equal to the liability of the secondary obligor on the instrument. In that event, the burden of
persuasion as to any lesser amount of the loss is on the person entitled to enforce the instrument.
